Getting Online with GitHub
Git: allows version control / history tracking.
Repository: like a folder, to store files, sub-folders, images, spreadsheets, data, etc online.
View the GitHub guide to getting started at: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world

Go to https://github.com/ 
Click Sign in (top right)
There should be a + next to your profile icon (top right), click this to add a repository.
Give your repository a name, choose whether it is public (accessible to all) or private and check the box to Initialize with a readme.
Start typing Markdown in the readme.md file! (see below for an example)
If returning to a previously created file in your repository, click the little pencil image to edit / continue working on it.
Once you have some Markdown text in your readme.md, go to the Settings tab.
Scroll down to GitHub Pages.
Select the master branch as the Source
Save and return to Settings, GitHub Pages to see the url link for your new webpage (yay!)
Scroll down a little further under Settings, GitHub Pages to choose a theme, because you want your webpage to look pretty (yes please!)
If, like Errol, you are “too cool for school”, you can choose the Slate theme.
Notice that a .yml file has been added to your repository. You can use the pencil icon to edit this.

NB - The file the becomes the home page of your webpage must be either
	Readme.md
	Index.html

# Main Heading
This will be my web page.

## Sub-heading
Use the hash-key to make sub-headings.

### Sub-sub-heading
Some text here.

Start a new paragraph by leaving a blank line in between lines of text.
Leave no space to have text on the same line.  
Leave two spaces at the end of the previous line to print text on new line without starting a paragraph.

## Formatting
Among standard text, we can include _italisiced text_  and also __bold text__, using underscores.

> This is a quote
> Quotes start with a greater than symbol and are formatted specially (usually indented).

Here is some code in-line: `code`.

This is a block of code:
```
if you see me around after OpenRes then:
	print(“hello”)
```

Highlight syntax for Python code:
```python
# we can also print comments
if you see me around after OpenRes then:
	print(“hello”)
```

## Lists
* item on my unordered list
* another item
* this is a sub-list item, it is indented by a tab

Now for an ordered list:
1. item 1 in my ordered list
1. item 2 -- Markdown will label this as 2.
	1. sub-item of ordered list will be indexed as i. when processed.
	1. sub-item ii.
1. return to main ordered list with item 3.

## Links and images

A link to Google:
[Text displayed in link](www.google.com “Hover-over text -- this is optional”)

An image (saved in figures folder), notice that it begins with an exclamation mark:
![Text displayed for visually impaired](figures/image_file_name.png “Hover-over text -- optional”)

An image not saved in a figures folder:
![Text displayed for visually impaired](image_file_name.png “Hover-over text -- optional”)

To change the image size, use html code:
<img src="figures/image_file_name.png" width='50%'>

## Emojis

Here is the GitHub icon :octocat:
